NOTE TO WRITERS:
The following sections should be customized for the technology.
This text was originally from the JAX-RS TCK.  Most references
to JAX-RS have been parameterized to serve as a simple starting
point for customization.  There are still many details that will
need to be changed or removed.  The major sections 4.1, 4.2, and
4.3 should be preserved.  If their titles are changed, the links
at the top of config.adoc will need to be changed as well as well
as toc.adoc.

4.1 Configuring Your Environment to Run the TCK Against the Compatible Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After configuring your environment as described in this section,
continue with the instructions in link:#GBFUY[Section 4.4, "Using the
JavaTest Harness Software."]


[NOTE]
=======================================================================

In these instructions, variables in angle brackets need to be expanded
for each platform. For example, `<TS_HOME>` becomes `$TS_HOME` on
Solaris/Linux and `%TS_HOME%` on Windows. In addition, the forward
slashes (`/`) used in all of the examples need to be replaced with
backslashes (`\`) for Windows. Finally, be sure to use the appropriate
separator for your operating system when specifying multiple path
entries (`;` on Windows, `:` on UNIX/Linux).

On Windows, you must escape any backslashes with an extra backslash in
path separators used in any of the following properties, or use forward
slashes as a path separator instead.

=======================================================================


1.  Set the following environment variables in your shell environment:
  a.  `JAVA_HOME` to the directory in which Java SE {SEversion} is installed
  b.  `TS_HOME` to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName} TCK
  {TechnologyVersion} software is installed
  c.  +{TechnologyHomeEnv}+ to the directory in which the {TechnologyShortName}
  {TechnologyVersion} CI has been installed
  d.  `PATH` to include the following directories: `JAVA_HOME/bin`
  and `ANT_HOME/bin`
2.  Edit your +{jteFileName}+ file and set the following
environment variables:
  a.  Set the `JAVA_HOME` property to the directory in which Java SE {SEversion}
  is installed.
  b. Set the `TS_HOME` property to the directory in which the
  {TechnologyShortName} TCK {TechnologyVersion} software is installed.
  c.  Set the +{TechnologyHomeEnv}+ property to the directory in which the
  {TechnologyShortName} {TechnologyVersion} CI has been installed.
3. Run the JavaTest harness in GUI or command-line mode, as described in
link:#GBFUY[Section 4.4, "Using the JavaTest Harness Software."]
